# Coursera-DDP-Week2-Project

## Leaflet Map Demo

### Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

### Review criteria 
The rubric contains the following two questions:

**Does the web page feature a date and is this date less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment?**

**Does the web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet?**

### Example Submissions
Here's an extremely minimal passing example, but we hope your submission is much cooler!
